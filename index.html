                    Ounce for ounce, almonds are higher in fiber, calcium, vitamin E, riboflavin and niacin than any other tree nut," Heap told Live Science. "Every one-ounce serving (about 23 almonds) provides 6 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, plus vitamin E (35 percent DV [daily value]), magnesium (20 percent DV), riboflavin (20 percent DV), calcium (8 percent DV) and potassium (6 percent DV). In addition, almonds are a low-glycemic index food.
                  A 2005 study published in the Journal of Nutrition showed that almonds pack the biggest nutritional punch if eaten whole, with their brown skins on (unblanched), rather than with their skins steamed off (blanched). The study identified 20 powerful antioxidant flavonoids in almond skin. Combined with the high vitamin E content in the meat of the almond, these flavonoids endow almonds with a unique nutritional package that may have implications for cholesterol levels, inflammation and more.

                <h2>Walnuts</h2>
                <p>
                   Walnuts (Juglans regia) are a tree nut belonging to the walnut family.
They originated in the Mediterranean region and Central Asia and have been part of the human diet for thousands of years.
These nuts are rich in omega-3 fats and contain higher amounts of antioxidants than most other foods. Eating walnuts may improve brain health and prevent heart disease and cancer (1Trusted Source).
                   Walnuts are most often eaten on their own as a snack but can also be added to salads, pastas, breakfast cereals, soups, and baked goods.They’re also used to make walnut oil — an expensive culinary oil frequently used in salad dressings.There are a few edible walnut species. This article is about the common walnut — sometimes referred to as the English or Persian walnut — which is grown worldwide.Another related species of commercial interest is the eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra), which is native to North America.

                <p>
                 Hazelnuts also contain decent amounts of vitamin B6, folate, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.Additionally, they are a rich source of mono- and polyunsaturated fats and contain a good amount of omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids, such as oleic acid.
                 Furthermore, a one-ounce serving provides 11.2 grams of dietary fiber, which accounts for about 11% of the RDI.However, hazelnuts contain phytic acid, which has been shown to impair the absorption of some minerals, like iron and zinc, from the nuts.
                  Hazelnuts are a rich source of vitamins and minerals like vitamin E, manganese and copper. Additionally, they have a high content of omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids.
